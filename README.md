# Saddl Portfolio Site

This is a premium portfolio/landing page for **Saddl**, demonstrating the "White Box" vs "Black Box" concept in Amazon PPC.

## Structure
- `index.html`: Main landing page.
- `css/style.css`: Styling (Dark mode, glassmorphism, animations).
- `js/main.js`: Scroll animations and interactions.

## How to Run
Since this is a static site, you can simply open `index.html` in your browser.

To run a local server (recommended for better asset loading):

### Using Python
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then visit `http://localhost:8000`

### Using VS Code
Right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server" if the extension is installed.
